üåä Overview


Storm surges represent abnormal sea level rises or falls caused by meteorological conditions such as atmospheric pressure changes and wind forcing. Accurate detection and analysis of these events are crucial for coastal management, hazard assessment, and understanding climate change impacts.


Storm surges can cause significant coastal flooding during extreme weather events, especially when they coincide with high tides. Conversely, negative storm surges (abnormally low water levels) can disrupt shipping and harbor operations. By accurately identifying and characterizing these events, coastal communities can develop more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.


This project implements a complete pipeline for storm surge analysis:

Harmonic Tidal Analysis - Identifying and extracting tidal constituents from sea level measurements by decomposing the signal into astronomical components (M2, S2, K1, etc.) using linear regression on trigonometric functions. This step isolates the predictable, astronomically-driven tidal variations.


Tidal Prediction - Reconstructing the pure astronomical tidal signal by combining the identified constituents with their calculated amplitudes and phases. This creates a "clean" tidal prediction that represents what would occur under normal astronomical forces alone.


Residual Calculation - Extracting the non-tidal (storm surge) component by subtracting the predicted tidal signal from original measurements. This residual contains all meteorological and other non-astronomical influences on sea level.


Signal Filtering - Separating meteorological signal from noise using Butterworth low-pass filters, which remove high-frequency oscillations while preserving the meteorologically-driven variations that typically occur over hours to days.


Event Detection - Identifying significant surge events with adaptive thresholding based on statistical properties of the data. The system automatically groups consecutive threshold exceedances into discrete events and calculates their key characteristics.


Visualization - Creating comprehensive educational visualizations of the results, including time series analysis, seasonal patterns, statistical distributions, and detailed event characterizations.


The modular architecture allows users to perform the complete analysis pipeline or utilize individual components for specific research needs. Each module can be run independently with appropriate input data, making the system adaptable to various research and operational contexts.

üî¨ Methodology

Tidal Harmonic Analysis

The model uses harmonic analysis to decompose tidal signals into constituent frequencies:

Constituent Identification: The model analyzes astronomical tidal constituents like M2 (principal lunar semidiurnal), S2 (principal solar semidiurnal), K1 (lunar diurnal), and others.
Each constituent represents a specific astronomical force with a known frequency:

M2 (12.42 hour period): Principal lunar semidiurnal tide, caused by the moon's gravitational pull

S2 (12.00 hour period): Principal solar semidiurnal tide, caused by the sun's gravitational pull

N2 (12.66 hour period): Larger lunar elliptic semidiurnal, related to monthly variations in moon's distance

K1 (23.93 hour period): Lunar diurnal tide, caused by lunar declination

O1 (25.82 hour period): Lunar diurnal tide, caused by lunar orbit inclination

Plus several others including shallow water overtides (M4) and long-period constituents (Mf, Mm, Ssa)


Design Matrix: A design matrix is constructed using sine and cosine terms for each constituent frequency.

For each constituent frequency (f), the model includes both sine and cosine components:

Cosine term: cos(2œÄft)

Sine term: sin(2œÄft)

This creates a design matrix X where each column represents either a sine or cosine component for a specific frequency, and each row represents a time point.

Linear Regression: The model uses linear regression to determine the amplitude and phase of each constituent.


The linear model fits: SSH = X¬∑Œ≤ + Œµ


Where:

SSH is the sea surface height measurements
X is the design matrix described above
Œ≤ are the coefficient parameters to be estimated
Œµ is the residual error

From the fitted coefficients, amplitude and phase are calculated as:

Amplitude = ‚àö(C¬≤+S¬≤) where C and S are the cosine and sine coefficients

Phase = arctan(S/C) (adjusted to appropriate quadrant)



Storm Surge Extraction

Storm surge is obtained by removing the predicted tidal signal from the original sea level measurements:

Storm Surge = Original SSH - Predicted Tide

This residual represents all non-tidal influences on sea level, including:


Meteorological effects (atmospheric pressure, wind forcing)
Oceanic circulation patterns
Measurement errors and instrumental noise
Seismic events (tsunamis, if present in the data)
Other unmodeled effects



The quality of storm surge extraction depends directly on the accuracy of the tidal prediction, which is why capturing all relevant tidal constituents is critical.


Signal Filtering
A Butterworth low-pass filter is applied to separate meteorological signals from noise:

Filter Design: A Butterworth filter is designed with customizable cutoff frequency and order.

The Butterworth filter is chosen because it has a maximally flat frequency response in the passband (minimal ripple), making it ideal for this application. Key parameters include:

Cutoff period: Typically 12 hours, to separate meteorological signals (which typically vary over days) from higher-frequency noise

Filter order: Typically 3-5, controlling the steepness of the roll-off

Sampling rate: Matched to the data collection frequency (typically hourly)


Application: The filter is applied to the raw storm surge to obtain a cleaner signal.

The implementation uses SciPy's filtfilt function, which applies the filter forward and backward to achieve zero phase distortion. This preserves the timing of surge events, which is critical for accurate event detection.

Comparison: The script provides tools to explore different filter settings and their effects.

Users can visualize how different filter parameters affect:

Signal preservation vs. noise reduction

Event onset/decay characteristics

Peak magnitude preservation

Event duration measurement



Event Detection

Significant events are identified using statistical thresholds:

Threshold Definition: Events are defined as exceedances of a threshold based on standard deviations (typically 2œÉ or 3œÉ).

The system supports multiple threshold approaches:

Statistical thresholds based on standard deviations from the mean

Absolute thresholds in physical units (meters)

Percentile-based thresholds (e.g., 95th or 99th percentile)


The default approach uses standard deviation multipliers to automatically adapt to the statistical properties of the specific data set being analyzed.

Event Grouping: Consecutive threshold exceedances are grouped into events.


The system applies these steps:

Identify all data points exceeding the threshold

Calculate time differences between consecutive exceedances

Group exceedances that occur within a specified time window (typically 3 hours)

Assign unique event IDs to each group of consecutive exceedances


Characterization: Events are characterized by their duration, peak magnitude, and direction (positive or negative).

For each identified event, the system calculates:

Start time and end time

Peak time (time of maximum absolute excursion)

Event duration (end time - start time)

Peak magnitude (maximum excursion during the event)

Direction (positive = higher than predicted, negative = lower than predicted)

Rate of onset (how quickly the surge developed)

Additional user-configurable metrics
