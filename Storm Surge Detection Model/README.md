# üìä A Comprehensive Tool for Tidal Analysis and Storm Surge Detection

This project provides a complete framework for performing harmonic tidal analysis, extracting storm surge signals, and identifying significant meteorological events affecting sea levels. Using advanced signal processing techniques, this toolset allows researchers, oceanographers, and coastal engineers to analyze sea level data, decompose it into tidal and non-tidal components, and detect extreme events.

## üåä Overview

Storm surges represent abnormal sea level rises or falls caused by meteorological conditions such as atmospheric pressure changes and wind forcing. Accurate detection and analysis of these events are crucial for coastal management, hazard assessment, and understanding climate change impacts.

Storm surges can cause significant coastal flooding during extreme weather events, especially when they coincide with high tides. Conversely, negative storm surges (abnormally low water levels) can disrupt shipping and harbor operations. By accurately identifying and characterizing these events, coastal communities can develop more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.

This project implements a complete pipeline for storm surge analysis:

- **Harmonic Tidal Analysis** ‚Äì Extract tidal constituents (M2, S2, K1, etc.) using linear regression on trigonometric functions.
- **Tidal Prediction** ‚Äì Reconstruct pure astronomical tidal signals using calculated amplitudes and phases.
- **Residual Calculation** ‚Äì Subtract predicted tide from original measurements to isolate non-tidal (storm surge) components.
- **Signal Filtering** ‚Äì Apply Butterworth low-pass filters to remove high-frequency noise while retaining meteorological signals.
- **Event Detection** ‚Äì Use adaptive thresholding to identify and group significant storm surge events.
- **Visualization** ‚Äì Produce detailed, educational plots of all analysis outputs.

Each module is independent, making the system flexible for different research needs.

üî¨ Methodology

Tidal Harmonic Analysis
Decomposes SSH signal into known constituents (M2, S2, K1, etc.)
Uses linear regression with sine and cosine terms:
Amplitude = ‚àö(C¬≤+S¬≤)
Phase = arctan(S/C)
Key frequencies:
M2 (12.42h), S2 (12.00h), N2, K1 (23.93h), O1 (25.82h), etc.
Storm Surge Extraction
Storm Surge = Original SSH - Predicted Tide
Includes meteorological influences (pressure, wind), ocean circulation, and other anomalies.

Signal Filtering
Butterworth low-pass filter:
Cutoff: ~12 hours
Order: 3‚Äì5
Zero-phase filtering (using filtfilt)
Allows tuning of:
Signal preservation vs. noise reduction
Event sharpness vs. smoothness
Event Detection
Thresholds: 2œÉ, 3œÉ, absolute meters, or percentile-based
Groups exceedances into events
Calculates:
Start/end time
Peak magnitude
Duration
Direction (positive/negative)
