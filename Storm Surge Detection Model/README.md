> **A comprehensive framework for tidal analysis and storm surge detection, now available in an easy-to-use Google Colab notebook!**

## üìä Overview

Storm surges represent abnormal sea level rises or falls caused by meteorological conditions such as atmospheric pressure changes and wind forcing. This toolkit provides a complete analysis pipeline that you can run **entirely in Google Colab** - no local installation required!

### Why use our Colab-ready model?

- **Instant setup** - Skip installation headaches
- **Interactive workflow** - Run each step in its own cell
- **Easy experimentation** - Modify parameters with simple widgets
- **Visual results** - See plots and analysis immediately
- **Cloud computing** - Process large datasets without local resources
- **Shareable analysis** - Collaborate seamlessly with colleagues

## ‚ú® Features

- **Robust Tidal Analysis**: Identify major and minor constituents (M2, S2, N2, K1, O1, etc.) with precise amplitudes and phases
- **Advanced Signal Processing**: Butterworth filtering with customizable cutoff frequency and filter order
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Multiple threshold methods (1œÉ‚Äì3œÉ, absolute, percentile-based)
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Time series plots, seasonal heatmaps, distribution histograms
- **Statistical Analysis**: Event duration, magnitude, onset rate, frequency of occurrence
- **Educational Components**: Detailed comments, explanations, and visual guides
- **Seasonal & Frequency Analysis**: Monthly patterns, statistical distributions, extreme value analysis
- **Extreme Event Identification**: Automated detection of significant surges with full event metadata

## üìä Data Requirements

Our model works with sea surface height (SSH) data, typically in CSV format. The data should:

- Contain time-series measurements of sea level
- Be regularly sampled (ideally hourly)
- Cover at least 1 month (preferably 1 year)
- Have minimal gaps (small gaps are interpolated)

üöÄ Getting Started with Google Colab

Open our notebook: Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of this README
Upload your data: Use the Colab file upload widget or connect to Google Drive
Run cells sequentially: Each analysis step is in its own cell
Visualize results: See plots and analysis in real-time
Experiment: Modify parameters and instantly see the effects

üìù Step-by-Step Analysis in Colab
Cell 1: Setup and Data Loading
python# Just run this cell to install all requirements
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn

# Upload your data or connect to Google Drive
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload your SSH data CSV
Cell 2: Determining Tidal Constituents
python# Run this cell to analyze tidal constituents
# Modify parameters as needed
input_file = "your_ssh_data.csv"
constituent_count = 8  # Change this to analyze more/fewer constituents

# The analysis runs automatically when you execute the cell!
# Results and visualizations appear below the cell
Cell 3: Predicting Tidal Signal
python# Run this cell to generate the predicted tidal signal
# Interactive widgets appear for customization
Cell 4: Calculating Storm Surge Residuals
python# Run this cell to extract the storm surge signal
# Plots show original, tidal, and residual components
Cell 5: Filtering and Event Detection
python# Interactive filter customization
cutoff_hours = 12  # Adjust the filter cutoff frequency
filter_order = 3   # Adjust the Butterworth filter order
threshold = 2.0    # Set detection threshold (œÉ units)

# The analysis updates as you modify parameters!
Cell 6: Visualization and Reporting
python# Generate comprehensive visualizations and reports
# Export results to your Google Drive if desired
üî¨ Methodology
Our approach combines several key techniques:

Tidal Harmonic Analysis

Decomposes SSH signal into known constituents (M2, S2, K1, etc.)
Uses linear regression with sine and cosine terms
Key frequencies: M2 (12.42h), S2 (12.00h), N2, K1 (23.93h), O1 (25.82h), etc.


Storm Surge Extraction

Storm Surge = Original SSH - Predicted Tide
Captures meteorological influences, ocean circulation, and anomalies


Signal Filtering

Butterworth low-pass filter with customizable parameters
Zero-phase filtering for accurate event timing


Event Detection

Multiple threshold options (statistical or absolute)
Automated event grouping and characterization
