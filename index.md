# Welcome to My Website

Hi, I'm Alireza, specializing in marine renewable energy resource assessment and climate change.
My research involves high-resolution hydrodynamic modeling to simulate coastal and estuarine processes, aiming to identify viable tidal energy sites and assess the predictability of currents.
I also explore wave, wind (onshore and offshore), and solar resources, analyzing their complementarity and weather windows for reliable energy harvesting.
I study the impacts of climate change on marine environments and how it affects the availability and stability of marine energy resources.
I have hands-on experience with a range of modeling tools, including CROCO, DHI MIKE, and DIVAST. 
With a background in coastal engineering and a strong computational skillset, I work extensively with high-performance computing systems and parallel programming to run large-scale simulations and process environmental datasets. 
I'm also passionate about education and have developed and taught courses for young students on marine and coastal engineering. 

This GitHub is where I share my research tools, modeling scripts, and educational projectsâ€”feel free to explore or get in touch!

Stay tuned for updates!
