# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Hi, I'm Alireza, a researcher specializing in marine renewable energy and climate change impacts. I use high-resolution hydrodynamic models to assess tidal, wave, wind, and solar resources, with a focus on their complementarity and predictability.

My work includes identifying viable tidal energy sites, simulating estuarine and coastal processes, and analyzing the effects of climate change on marine resource availability. Iâ€™m experienced with modeling tools like CROCO, DHI MIKE, and DIVAST, and I regularly work on HPC systems using parallel programming to run and analyze large-scale simulations.

I'm also passionate about outreach and have designed and taught educational programs on marine and coastal engineering for young students.
