# 🌊 Ocean Defenders of Ireland 🏝️🇮🇪

## Interactive Educational Simulation for Young Scientists

*A fun, educational program that teaches 10-14 year olds about coastal science and protection in Ireland*

## 📚 Overview

Ocean Defenders of Ireland is an immersive educational simulation designed to teach young students (ages 10-14) about coastal science, oceanography, and environmental protection. Through interactive simulations and challenges, students will explore how waves form, how coastal erosion occurs, and how to protect coastal communities from storm surges.

With Ireland's 3,000+ kilometers of coastline facing challenges from climate change and rising sea levels, this program helps create awareness and understanding of coastal processes in a fun, engaging way.

## 🎯 Educational Objectives

- Understand the physics of ocean waves and how they're affected by wind and depth
- Learn about coastal erosion and the factors that influence it (rock type, sea level, storms)
- Explore engineering solutions for protecting coastal communities
- Discover interesting facts about Ireland's unique coastline
- Develop critical thinking through interactive challenges
- Connect scientific concepts to real-world environmental issues

## ✨ Features

### 🌊 Ocean Waves Simulation
- Interactive 3D visualization of ocean waves
- Adjustable wave height and wind speed
